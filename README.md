# My OpenTelemetry example for Python

## Python instrumentation inspired by
https://words.boten.ca/Practical-OpenTelemetry-part-1-Python/

## Goals
See how application monitoring can be integrated via backends (Jaeger, Prometheus)
or even generate alerts (e.g. Prometheus <-> Nagios, Prometheus <-> Checkmk).
